# Microsoft Authentication Library for Python

The Microsoft Authentication Library for Python enables applications to integrate with the [Microsoft identity platform](https://aka.ms/aaddevv2). It allows you to sign in users or apps with Microsoft identities (Azure AD, Microsoft accounts and Azure AD B2C accounts) and obtain tokens to call Microsoft APIs such as [Microsoft Graph](https://graph.microsoft.io/) or your own APIs registered with the Microsoft identity platform. It is built using industry standard OAuth2 and OpenID Connect protocols.
