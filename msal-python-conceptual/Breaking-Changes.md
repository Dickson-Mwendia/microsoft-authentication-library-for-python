We have adopted the [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/)
that is industry standard for OSS projects.

Per semantic versioning spec, breaking changes (a.k.a. incompatible changes) will only be released with a major version bump. When that happens, we will document that change in the [release notes](../releases).
